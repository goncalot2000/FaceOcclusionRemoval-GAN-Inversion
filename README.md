> Abstract: Facial occlusions present a challenging problem in computer vision, affecting various applications such as face recognition and image analysis. The proposed method incorporates prior knowledge by using a set of face images without any occlusion as a reference during the reconstruction process. By inverting the latent codes of the occlusion-free reference images, a representative latent space is established. Notably, this approach distinguishes itself from existing methods by incorporating additional information about the person's face through the use of reference images.

As StyleGAN uses aligned face for GAN training, all faces used in this repo are pre-aligned. The alignment method can be found at [stylegan-encoder](https://github.com/Puzer/stylegan-encoder).

## Installation

1. Create a virtual envirnoment via 'conda' with python 3.10
2. Install 'cuda' 11.6
3. Install all the dependencies using the following code.
```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data Input

All the synthetic face occlusions used were produced by [face-occlusion-generator](https://github.com/kennyvoo/face-occlusion-generation).

| Path | Description
| :--- | :----------
| dataset | Main directory
| &ensp;&ensp;&boxvr;&nbsp; Abdullah_Gul | First person from the dataset
| &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&boxvr;&nbsp; occluded_img | Directory containing the images to be reconstucted 
| &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&boxvr;&nbsp; occlusion_mask | Directory containing the binary occlusion masks for the images being reconstucted 
| &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&boxvr;&nbsp; reference_imgs | Directory containing the reference images
| &ensp;&ensp;&boxvr;&nbsp; Al_Gore | Second person from the dataset
| &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&boxvr;&nbsp; occluded_img | Directory containing the images to be reconstucted 
| &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&boxvr;&nbsp; occlusion_mask | Directory containing the binary occlusion masks for the images being reconstucted 
| &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&boxvr;&nbsp; reference_imgs | Directory containing the reference images

**NOTE:** Both occluded images and the corresponding occlusions masks need to have the same name.
